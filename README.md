# Model Deployment

This is a presentation in the form of a Streamlit application about basic ML showcasing and deployment techniques with tools like Streamlit, Flask, Docker, MLflow, BentoML, GCP and Gradio.

This presentation / app was developed in 2022 when I got familiar with the mentioned tools.
